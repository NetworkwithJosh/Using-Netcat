Implementing Encrypted Communication
In our final step, let's add a layer of security to our communication by implementing encryption using OpenSSL and integrating it with Netcat. Encryption is essential for protecting sensitive information from being intercepted and read by unauthorized parties during network transmission.

We have already learned how to use OpenSSL in the previous labs. OpenSSL provides robust cryptographic functions that we'll leverage to secure our messages. Specifically, we'll use the openssl enc command to encrypt and decrypt messages using the AES-256-CBC cipher, which is a strong symmetric encryption algorithm. We'll also use a passphrase to derive the encryption key - think of this as a shared secret between the sender and receiver.


Encrypted Communication with Netcat + OpenSSL

In this final stage of the lab, I built a simple, secure communication system using:

Netcat (nc) to transmit messages

OpenSSL to encrypt and decrypt data using AES-256-CBC

A shared secret passphrase for key derivation via PBKDF2

This setup demonstrates how encrypted communication can be implemented over a network using shell scripting and command-line tools.
This involes secure_receiver.sh and secure_sender.sh we both create nano of them.
After you save both of them. You can send messages to them.

-------------->

In the receiver terminal, you should see the decrypted message appear exactly as you typed it in the sender terminal.

You can continue sending messages from the sender terminal, and they will be automatically encrypted, sent, received, and decrypted in the receiver terminal. This demonstrates a complete secure communication loop.

To end the communication, press Ctrl+C in both terminals. This safely terminates both scripts.

This setup demonstrates a simple yet effective encrypted communication system. While we're using localhost for testing, this same approach works across networks. The messages are automatically encrypted before transmission and decrypted upon receipt, providing a secure channel for communication. Remember that in real-world applications, you would want to use more secure methods for key exchange than a hardcoded password.

------------------
In this lab, you have learned the fundamentals of network communication using Netcat and explored basic encryption techniques for secure data transfer. You've practiced installing Netcat, establishing connections through specific ports, and transferring files between systems.

This hands-on experience demonstrated the importance of encryption in network communications through practical implementation with OpenSSL. These foundational skills provide a solid starting point for understanding more complex cybersecurity concepts and secure communication protocols.
